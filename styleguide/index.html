<h1>This Is a Style Guide (And Headline 1)</h1>

<p>How to make a post sexy in three easy steps. First, make sure you can see the advanced editing options by clicking on the "Show/Hide Kitchen Sink" button in the toolbar.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Use headlines. (This is Headline 2.)</h2>

<p>Rather than trying to delineate content sections with bolded text, use a headline to really create vertical separation.</p>

<h3>Headline Tips</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Breaking content with a headline every paragraph or two aids legibility</li>
    <li>Make headlines tell the story on their own</li>
    <li>Keep them punchy and loaded with keywords</li>
</ol>

<h3>However. (This is Headline 3.)</h3>

<p>Keep in mind that Heading 1 is used for the site title and Heading 2 is used for the article/page title, so you shouldn't use those in the body text.</p>

<h2>Step 2. ?????</h2>

<p>This is where you come in. You know how to write stuff. To quote someone I met in a bar once:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>That's not my job.</p>

    <p class="attribution">&ndash; Someone I met in a bar once</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To use a blockquote (the above):

<ul>
    <li>Click the double quote button in the toolbar</li>
    <li>Add an attribution like the one above by pressing press <code>alt + -</code>.</p>

<h2>Step 3. PROFIT!</h2>

<p>If you follow these three easy steps, you will surely be wicked loaded.</p>

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

<p>Some other things to think about.</p>

<h3>SEO Stuff</h3>

<p>It's probably worth coming up with an SEO title and a meta description for each post. This is what will show up on Facebook when people share, and it's also what Google will show people when they search.</p>

<h3>Featured Image</h3>

<p>Set a featured image at the bottom of the right-hand column. This will be displayed on Facebook when the post is shared.</p>

<h3>Your Post Slug</h3>

<p>The slug (called the permalink above the editing box) helps SEO and linkability. WordPress will automatically generate one for you, but it's worth double-checking before you post.</p>

<h4>IMPORTANT: Don't change permalinks (This is Headline 4)</h4>

<p><em>DON'T change this after you've published. It will break any links to the post that live anywhere else on the internet.</em></p>
